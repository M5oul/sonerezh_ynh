## Postinstallation
Currently, you will have to do manually postinstallation.
There is [an issue](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/sonerezh_ynh/issues/1) to solve that issue. But I wasn't able to solved it.

You will have to go to `/sonerezh/install/` and put this parameters:

- Retrieve database password:
```bash
sudo cat /etc/yunohost/apps/sonerezh/settings.yml | grep mysql
```
- Put your email and password to create an account.

## Music
Actually, sonerezh do not provide a web interface to upload music.
You have to store your music in `/home/yunohost.app/sonerezh`.
sonerezh will update your music.
